            Throughout my role as a technical intern, I demonstrated proficiency in diagnosing and resolving issues across a spectrum of devices, encompassing laptops, desktops, projectors, printers, and diverse technological assets. In addition to this, I took on the responsibility of re-imaging devices to optimize their performance. Providing adept technical support to students, I ensured efficient resolution of their queries and concerns.

            In a proactive capacity, I endeavored to enhance operational efficiency by implementing automation solutions. This encompassed automating routine tasks, such as email communications, and simplifying troubleshooting procedures for common computer issues.
